**This won't work with wireless versions as you need to cut off the part of the pcb with the battery connections to fit in the case.**

---

Assembly materials needed:
---

- **14x** m2x4mm screws
- **7x** m2x8mm round threaded standoffs
- **4x** 8mm rubber bumpons (optional). (Pictures show an older revision with foam feet)
- **Drill with 2mm bit to drill through sacrificial layers on mounting holes.**

Please note:

- You need to cut off the part of the pcb that sticks out with "SW2" printed next to it, it's only needed for wireless builds. I've put a picture of the part in the images folder: `/_Images/pcb.png`
- The mounting holes are "closed" to print without supports, you'll need to drill through the sacrificial layers from the top with a 2mm bit.
- You'll need to print the split files with "Split-L/R" suffix if your printer bed is smaller than about 250x250mm.
